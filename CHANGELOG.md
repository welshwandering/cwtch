## [Unreleased]

## [5.0.0] - 2025-12-07

### Added

- **Configuration sync from Git repositories** — New `cwtch sync` command pulls commands, agents, hooks, and MCP servers from remote repos
- **Cwtchfile** — Declarative YAML configuration at `~/.cwtch/Cwtchfile`
- **Namespace-based merging** — Multiple sources coexist via the `as:` field (e.g., `/personal/review`, `/work/deploy`)
- **MCP server merging** — MCP configurations are deep-merged into `settings.json`
- **Base settings and CLAUDE.md** — Sync global settings and CLAUDE.md from repositories
- `cwtch sync init` — Create an example Cwtchfile
- `cwtch sync check` — Validate Cwtchfile without syncing
- `cwtch edit` — Open Cwtchfile in your editor
- `yq` dependency for YAML parsing

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: Profiles now store only credentials, not entire `~/.claude/` directory
- **BREAKING**: `cwtch profile use` no longer modifies `~/.claude/` — use `cwtch sync` for configuration
- `cwtch status` now shows sync state alongside profile and usage
- Architecture refactored to separate identity (credentials) from configuration (agents/commands)
